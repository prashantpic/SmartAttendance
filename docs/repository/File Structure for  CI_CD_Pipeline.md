# 1. Files

- **Path:** .github/workflows/pr-check.yml  
**Description:** GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Integration. Triggers on pull requests targeting the 'main' branch. It performs static analysis, runs unit and widget tests, and executes integration tests to validate code quality and functionality before merging.  
**Template:** GitHub Actions Workflow  
**Dependency Level:** 0  
**Name:** pr-check  
**Type:** CI Workflow  
**Relative Path:** .github/workflows/pr-check.yml  
**Repository Id:** REPO-010-DVO  
**Pattern Ids:**
    
    - PipelineAsCode
    
**Members:**
    
    
**Methods:**
    
    
**Implemented Features:**
    
    - Automated Static Analysis
    - Automated Unit and Widget Testing
    - Automated Integration Testing
    - Pull Request Quality Gate
    
**Requirement Ids:**
    
    - 2.1.1
    - 7.1
    - 6.10
    
**Purpose:** To serve as the primary quality gate for the codebase, ensuring that all contributions adhere to coding standards and pass all automated tests before being considered for inclusion in the main branch.  
**Logic Description:** The workflow is triggered on 'pull_request' events for the 'main' branch. It defines three main jobs that run in parallel: 'lint', 'unit_tests', and 'integration_tests'. The 'lint' job checks out the code and runs 'flutter analyze'. The 'unit_tests' job runs 'flutter test --coverage'. The 'integration_tests' job sets up a specific device emulator, builds the app, and runs tests from the 'integration_test' directory. The pull request is blocked from merging if any of these jobs fail.

    - **Summary:** This workflow file defines the automated checks for all pull requests. It validates the code that implements features such as user authentication (REQ-2.1.1), admin reporting (REQ-7.1), and Google Sheets integration (REQ-6.10) by executing the corresponding integration tests.

- **Path:** .github/workflows/deploy-main.yml  
**Description:** GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Deployment. Triggers on pushes to the 'main' branch. It automates the building of all artifacts and their deployment to the 'staging' environment, including the Flutter app to mobile testing platforms and Firebase assets to the staging project.  
**Template:** GitHub Actions Workflow  
**Dependency Level:** 0  
**Name:** deploy-main  
**Type:** CD Workflow  
**Relative Path:** .github/workflows/deploy-main.yml  
**Repository Id:** REPO-010-DVO  
**Pattern Ids:**

**Members:**
    
    
**Methods:**
    
    
**Implemented Features:**
    
    - Automated Staging Deployment
    - Android Deployment to Google Play Internal Testing
    - iOS Deployment to TestFlight
    - Firebase Assets Deployment
    
**Requirement Ids:**
    
    - 2.1.1
    - 7.1
    - 6.10
    
**Purpose:** To automate the release of successfully tested code to the staging environment, ensuring a consistent and repeatable deployment process for stakeholder review and final validation.  
**Logic Description:** The workflow is triggered on 'push' events to the 'main' branch. It uses a concurrency group to ensure only one deployment runs at a time. It defines a build job that creates and archives all necessary artifacts. Subsequent jobs depend on the build job and run in parallel: 'deploy-firebase' (uses Firebase CLI to deploy to the staging project), 'deploy-android' (deploys the AAB to Google Play), and 'deploy-ios' (deploys the IPA to TestFlight). All jobs use GitHub secrets for credentials and keys.

    - **Summary:** This workflow file defines the automated deployment process for the main branch. It handles the packaging and distribution of the application implementing features like user authentication (REQ-2.1.1), admin reporting (REQ-7.1), and Google Sheets integration (REQ-6.10) to their respective staging platforms.
