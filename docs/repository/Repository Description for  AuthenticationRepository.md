# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
AuthenticationRepository


---

# 2. Description
A client-side data layer repository in the Flutter application that abstracts all interactions with Firebase Authentication. It provides a clean interface for the application logic layer to perform sign-in (Email/Password, Phone OTP), sign-up, sign-out, and password reset operations. It also handles the retrieval and caching of the user's ID token and associated custom claims (tenantId, role) which are crucial for client-side logic and securing Firestore requests.
