# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
CI_CD_Pipeline


---

# 2. Description
An automated CI/CD pipeline defined in GitHub Actions. It triggers on every commit to run static analysis (linting) and a full suite of tests (unit, widget, integration). On merges to the main branch, it automates the build and deployment of the Flutter app to TestFlight and Google Play Internal Testing, and deploys all Firebase assets (Functions, Security Rules, Hosting) to the staging environment, ensuring a consistent and reliable release process.
