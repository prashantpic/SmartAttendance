# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
FirestoreSecurityRules


---

# 2. Description
A declarative configuration file that defines the access control logic for the entire Firestore database. This is a critical security endpoint. It ensures strict multi-tenant data isolation, where users can only access data within their own tenant's path. It also enforces the role-based (Admin, Supervisor, Subordinate) and hierarchical access rules, such as a supervisor only being able to read data of their direct and indirect reports.
