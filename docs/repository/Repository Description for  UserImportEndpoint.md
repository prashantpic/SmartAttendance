# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
UserImportEndpoint


---

# 2. Description
A Cloud Storage-triggered Cloud Function that processes bulk user data uploads. An Admin uploads a CSV file to a specific path, which triggers this function. It parses the file, validates each row against business rules (e.g., valid email, supervisor exists), creates new user accounts with an 'Invited' status, and builds the reporting hierarchy. Finally, it generates a validation report detailing successful and failed imports for the Admin to review.
