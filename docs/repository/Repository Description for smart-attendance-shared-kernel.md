# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
smart-attendance-shared-kernel


---

# 2. Description
This repository acts as a 'SharedKernel' or a common utility library, containing essential code intended for reuse within the primary Flutter mobile application ('smart-attendance-mobile-app'). Its purpose is to enforce consistency, reduce code duplication, and provide a single source of truth for core client-side entities. The repository's primary responsibilities include: defining all core Dart data models (e.g., User, Attendance, Event) complete with serialization/deserialization logic (fromJson/toJson methods); providing a collection of common helper and utility functions for tasks like date formatting, input validation, and permission handling; centralizing the application's theme data, including color palettes, typography, and spacing rules; and housing a library of generic, reusable UI widgets, such as custom-styled buttons, loading indicators, dialogs, and form fields, which are used across multiple features and screens.
