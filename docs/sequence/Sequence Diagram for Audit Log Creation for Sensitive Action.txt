    Admin-REPO001CLIENT: 1. Changes user's role to 'Supervisor' and saves
    activate REPO001CLIENT

    REPO001CLIENT-REPO003DB: 2. update('/tenants/{id}/users/user123', { role: 'Supervisor' })
    activate REPO003DB
    note over REPO001CLIENT: The client receives an immediate acknowledgment for its write request. The audit logging process happens asynchronously in the background, decoupled from the client.
    REPO003DB--REPO001CLIENT: ack(Success/Failure)
    deactivate REPO001CLIENT
    deactivate REPO003DB

    REPO003DB-REPO010SVCAUDIT: 3. [Event] onUpdate: /tenants/{id}/users/user123
    activate REPO010SVCAUDIT
    note right of REPO010SVCAUDIT: The onUpdate event trigger provides the function with two snapshots of the document: change.before and change.after. This allows the function to compare the data and see what changed.

    REPO010SVCAUDIT-REPO010SVCAUDIT: 3.1. Extracts 'before' and 'after' data snapshots from event

    alt 3.2. Condition: Check if role has changed
        REPO010SVCAUDIT-REPO010SVCAUDIT: 3.2.1. Constructs audit log payload
        note right of REPO010SVCAUDIT: The function must determine the actorId (the Admin who made the change). This is typically derived from Cloud Audit Logs or by requiring the client to pass the actor's ID as part of the initial update request.
        REPO010SVCAUDIT--REPO010SVCAUDIT: auditPayload: { actorId, action, targetId, details }

        REPO010SVCAUDIT-REPO003DB: 3.2.2. create('/tenants/{id}/auditLogs/{logId}', auditPayload)
        activate REPO003DB
        note right of REPO010SVCAUDIT: If the write to the auditLogs collection fails, the Cloud Function's execution fails. Firebase will automatically retry the function based on its configuration.
        REPO003DB--REPO010SVCAUDIT: ack(Success)
        deactivate REPO003DB
