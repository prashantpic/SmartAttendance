# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . User Authentication with App Check
  Models a standard user login flow, explicitly showing the role of Firebase App Check. Before the app communicates with Firebase Authentication, it first obtains an App Check token to prove its authenticity, which is then verified by the backend services.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To illustrate the crucial security measure of protecting backend resources from abuse and unauthorized clients.

  #### .5. Type
  AuthenticationFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - flutter-mobile-app
  - firebase-app-check
  - firebase-auth
  - firestore-db
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - User initiates login in the Flutter App.
  - App requests and receives a time-limited token from Firebase App Check.
  - App makes a sign-in request to Firebase Authentication, including the App Check token in the request headers.
  - Firebase Authentication backend verifies the App Check token before processing the login credentials.
  - Upon successful login, app receives an ID token and makes a request to Firestore (e.g., to get user profile).
  - Firestore also verifies the App Check token on this subsequent request before granting access.
